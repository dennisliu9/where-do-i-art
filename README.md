# Where Do I.Art?

A web application for the art curious who want to discover what art they like.

## Why I Built This

The world of art is so vast and diverse that it can be hard for a beginner to know where to start. High quality art books are expensive, and museums are only accessible to those who can get there. The Internet and technology-based art initiatives have made mountains of artwork available to almost anyone, but finding which direction to start exploring is still a challenge.

I made this app so that newcomers to art (including myself!) can jump right into discovering what interests and excites them.
